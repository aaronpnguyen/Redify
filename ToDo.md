# Redify Todo

#### Finish Dark Mode
	[] Should target cards and text
	[] Button needs to change 

#### Home Page
	[] Style “Create a Post”
	[] Fix Sticky Box

#### User Profile
	[] Sticky position favorites table

#### View Topic
	[] When the topic has only one entry the spacing is wack
	[] The track card is not proper width

#### View Post
	[] !! THIS NEEDS DONE STILL

#### View Stats
	[] Currently no button or link to it
	[] Tab system needs polished

#### View Settings
	[] Account settings box spacing is poop
	[] Title needs cleaned up a bit and single line

## Bugs 
- Clicking the search icon should result in triggering the text input field
— The search should maybe contain like the topics and appear after a letter or two






#### Strictly Backend
	[] The stats page doesn't have access to user
	[] Trending board is currently broken, save results in redirect for permision but then redirects back to home page still containing the save button not tracks
	[] Currently cant view the -- View One Post -- it gives a tuplex out of order error
	[] Profile Page -> Number of Topics card and the other ???
